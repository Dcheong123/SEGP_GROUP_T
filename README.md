# Abstract
Transport is an essential infrastructure and it is part and parcel of our daily life. Accoring to the transport sector, transport makes a significant contribution to CO2 emission in Malaysia. In this project, we will generate a carbon footprint calculator (CarboNet) in order to calculate the amount of carbon emissions. The vehicle model and the distance travelled will be taken into consideration. \
\
The programming languagues which will be used for frontend and backend development:
- Frontend : React will be used for web development.
- Backend : Django will be used to build machine learning model
# Proposal Timeline
Before Jan 20:
- Group members will be assigned either work on frontend or backend tasks.
- To familiarize completely with React's and Django's functionality and architecture.
- Do self coding with React and Django to improve self understanding.

Before Feb 3:
- Have a discussion and confirm the web design and the carbon calculator's functionality. 
- initial implementation on both web design and backend development.

After Feb 3:
- improve and update the progess.
